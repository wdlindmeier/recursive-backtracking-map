Recursive Backtracking Map
==========================

An example of Recursive Backtracking to find the shortest route between two nodes.

Created for [Evolution as a Creative Tool](http://evolutionary.patrickhebron.com/) at [ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu).

####Usage
Click on any two cities to find the shortest route between the two. Increase the "animation delay" to slow down the algorithm enough to watch it perform the search.
